# The British Special Operations Executive in WW2

## Overview: 
Our interactive website is dedicated to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a secret British organisation formed during World War II to conduct espionage, sabotage, and support resistance movements across Nazi-occupied Europe and parts of Japanese-occupied Asia. Founded in 1940 under Winston Churchill’s directive to “set Europe ablaze,” the SOE operated in the shadows—but their impact was undeniable.

Taking a feminist lens, this project not only uncovers the hidden history of the SOE but also highlights the bravery and resilience of the many female agents involved, such as Noor Inayat Khan and Violette Szabo. Their contributions challenge traditional wartime narratives and broaden our understanding of gender roles during times of conflict. These once-silenced stories of courage and defiance serve as a reminder of the women who helped ignite the flames of resistance across Europe.
