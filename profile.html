            <h2>Noor Inayat Khan</h2>
            <p>Noor Un Nisa Inayat Khan, she was a brave SOE agent born in 1914 from Moscow Russia and was given the codename Madeline in the military, her background is incredibly interesting as she was a descendant of Indian royalty and brought up with the ideology of being a pacifist. When she joined the SOE in order to serve freedom she was first trained up to be a wireless operator, which was deemed as one of the most dangerous roles in the whole SOE. One of her biggest accomplishments whilst being in the force was that she was the first female radio communications operator to be sent into the dangerous Nazi occupied France, and it was said that she kept up strong communications for seven months. But she was eventually found by the ruthless Gestapo and then captured where she would then be tortured and chained up for ten months before she was then executed, she remained strong the whole time and never gave the Nazi's any information and she will be remembered as a heroine and a true patriot to freedom.</p>
